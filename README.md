# MY PROJECT

    This program takes full name and birth date from user, stores this information 
and uses it to determine key Numerological meanings. 
    Calc Life Path: Sums of digits for a day, for a month and year get summarized 
again and again until value is between 1 to 9. Display meaning of the number.
    Calc Expression Number: Each letter of the alphabet has a numerical value assigned to it. 
Received full name is broken down in chars and they are compared to numerical value 
they are assigned to. These values are summarized, digits of the sum are summarized 
again until their value is within 1 to 9. Display meaning of expression number by reading 
from the file particularly assigned lines.
    Lo Shu Grid: calculate repetition of each digit in the birth date. Digit and times it occurs 
in birth date ( up to 4 only) correspond to the personality trait in a grid.
