>>> Expression number 1 <<<

With a 1 Expression number, you possess strong leadership capabilities and a knack for creating your own opportunities. 
You will go where others are afraid to go and you'll make the journey look easy. The number 1's energy is extremely self-sufficient,
allowing you to be most innovative and productive when you're working alone. You may even find it difficult to cooperate with others,
preferring to do things your way rather than listening to anyone else's opinions. If you aren't careful, the 1 Expression could make you
seem aggressive and self-centered. It's not in your nature to think before you speak or act, but you would be wise to learn this skill!

>>> RED  <<<

The most dominant personality. A visionary and risk-taker: energetic, passionate, tenacious, flamboyant and courageous.
	
>>> Expression number 2 <<<

Working with others is your forte. Your 2 Expression makes you very skilled in relationships of all kinds, because it is cooperative, 
supportive, and always striving for balance. You have a keen ability to read people and situations and react with patience and understanding. 
Others see you as peaceful and humble, yet there is great strength in you. Still, your feelings can be easily hurt and you have a tendency to 
doubt yourself when making decisions, which can make you idle. You would benefit from following your head instead of your heart from time to time.

>>> ORANGE <<<

Balanced both mentally and physically. Happy, loyal, takes each day as it comes.
	
>>> Expression number 3 <<<

With the influence of the number 3, you are a naturally skilled communicator. You have a way with words and a great talent for conveying your
creative ideas and inspiring others. Your social circle is strong and people find your optimistic attitude both magnetic and charming. However, 
the relationships you form, like many other things in your life, don't go very deep. Your enthusiasm for life can be a distraction, making you unable
to stay focused on one person, job, or plan long enough for it to develop into something complete or meaningful.

>>> YELLOW <<<

Cheerful, charming, magnetic, intelligent, confident, and creative. Somewhat psychic and enigmatic. A good leader and negotiator.
	
>>> Expression number 4 <<<

Organized, down-to-earth, and hardworking, the 4 Expression gives you skills that make you incredibly capable and constructive. 
You are a master at managing projects and teams and others rely on you because you follow everything through to completion. 
You are honest, patient, and loyal -- sometimes, loyal to a fault. The number 4 carries a stubborn, rigid energy that can make you 
so fixed in your ways that you are unable to grasp new, better ways of thinking, doing, and interacting.

 >>> GREEN <<<

The perfect balance between between the physical and mental. Grounded, logical, not easily influenced, rarely judgmental. 
An intensely loyal friend - and has lots of them.
	
 >>> Expression number 5 <<<

Your 5 Expression craves variety and freedom and wants to experience everything that life has to offer. You are an adventurous 
person who takes pleasure in trying new things and following your latest passion. Your passions change quickly, however, 
so you've learned to switch gears easily in order to explore as many possibilities as you can. Beware, though, that with all this 
change comes inconsistency. Your restlessness can make you unreliable in relationships and unprepared to handle the hardships of life.

 >>> BLUE <<<

Optimistic, empathetic, flexible, idealistic, tranquil, patient, devoted. A natural mother.
	
>>> Expression number 6 <<<

Your strengths play out most notably in your relationships with others. The influence of the number 6 makes you incredibly protective
and nurturing toward all people, but especially your family members and other close loved ones. You have a heart of gold and feel a 
responsibility to be there to help those in need of support. It's important, though, that you don't forget about self-care. You can be so 
focused on the well-being of others that you neglect to attend to your own emotions and energy levels. Be kind to yourself, too.

 >>> INDIGO <<<

A brilliant old soul who is intuitive, sensitive, impulsive, curious, and ambitious, with a great lust for life.
	
 >>> Expression number 7 <<<

You are the truth seeker. You are energized by information and willing to go deep into both the intellectual and spiritual realms in search
of real meaning. Logic drives the way you think and communicate, and this helps you clearly convey your vast knowledge to others. 
You are not satisfied with what's on the surface -- it's the hidden answers you are digging for. However, this assumption that there is always
something to be found can make you suspicious of others. In fact, it may be hard for you to relate to other people in general; you tend to 
prefer a controlled environment where you can do things your own way.

 >>> VIOLET <<<

An old soul. Intense, cerebral, wise, loving, generous, sentimental, and artistic. 
	
>>> Expression number 8 <<<

An 8 Expression blesses you with great business sense and excellent judgement of people, money, and plans. This is why you are able to
achieve so many goals -- you know the best resources and the most attainable ambitions. You do run the risk of being too ambitious, however,
and turning from an effective leader into an impatient taskmaster. While your drive to attain success and material wealth is powerful, it's important
that you balance it with meaningful people, emotions, and experiences.

>>> ROSE <<<

Main qualities are strength, love, and leadership. Turns visions into realities. 
	
>>> Expression number 9 <<<

Your 9 Expression is creative and compassionate and encourages you to find the best in everybody. Whether you're providing emotional support
to a friend or engaged in a larger humanitarian effort, you strive to make life better for others. People see you as being friendly and affectionate, 
as long as you are immersing yourself in this altruistic work. If you are not living life in a way that is beneficial to other people, you could become 
self-centered and detached from important emotions.

>>> GOLD <<<

Radiates love, joy, compassion, and understanding.
